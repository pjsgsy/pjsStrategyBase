This is NOT intended to be a working strategy. It may not compile without a few simple tweaks for your side. But, it is a complete, first attempt to build a reasonable template I can use for multiple strategy projects, without re-inventing the wheel each time.  There are sections where you can easily add your go long / go short logic. 

it includes the buttons along the bottom right, and the status display in the top left.

There is NO support - But, your constructive feedback and code suggestions/improvements are welcome.  This is a first draft of code. I would call it an Alpha! There may be incomplete code, test code, and things that do not work as intended. I will be, no doubt, at times, very actively changing this code my side - I would hope to share those changes as I get time.

If you found this useful, please at least give it a little start/like! If this does not happen, I will see no point in updating the code here.  Enjoy.
